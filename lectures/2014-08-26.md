# Lecture 1. - Introduction to Node.js and JavaScript

> Date 26/08/2014

This course (TT00CC06-3001) is about getting to know [Node.js][] and tools that are made with it.

The primary focus is towards functionality and tooling that can improve the workflow of a Web Developer.


## Testing your initial JavaScript skills

[You can't JavaScript under pressure](http://games.usvsth3m.com/javascript-under-pressure/ "You can't JavaScript under pressure")

Below are two first tests extracted from the above game.

---

`i` will be an integer. Double it and return it.

```js
function doubleInteger(i) {
    return i;    
}
```

```js
function doubleInteger(i) {
    return i * 2;    
}
```

```js
assert(doubleInteger(123) === 246);
```

---

`i` will be an integer. Return true if it's even, and false if it isn't.

```js
function isNumberEven(i) {

}
```

```js
function isNumberEven(i) {
    return i % 2 === 0;    
}
```

```js
assert(isNumberEven(1) === false);
assert(isNumberEven(2) === true);
```

## Testing Node.js in the cloud

While the local development environment is not necessarily available, there are few service which
provide virtual machines that can host environments such as Node.js.
